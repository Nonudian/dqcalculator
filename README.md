# Dragon Quest Calculator

Based on the mobile game [Dragon Quest TACT](https://dragonquest.square-enix-games.com/tact/en-us/), this repository represents a Google Sheets script (the back) allowing game monitoring and some computing automation for the player (inventory, characters, items, progression, etc.). Of course, the Google Sheets page (the front) won't be shared because of personal use. 

It was lately imported from [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/Nonudian/dqcalculator), where full commits history is available.

I wrote it in TypeScript for fun.
